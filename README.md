A Fedora Spin inspired by Omarchy (This Is Not Omarchy)

This is an opinionated Fedora Spin set up with keybindings from Omarchy, menu system and desktop environment in the same style as Omarchy (Hyprland), but none of the DHH specific applications like BaseCamp, Hey, etc.

The goal is a very narrow and focused one: to build a highly opinionated environment that I can personally use, but that is generic enough that a Mac or Windows user coming over to Linux can transition over with a little effort on their part.  The spin highlights some of the advanages of immutable distributions and the stability they provide, without being overly annoying, and should highlight that with enough care and thought, Fedora is as worthy of a target as Arch is for delivering a system that treats users with respect rather than scorn.

Right now, it's just a README and an idea.  And that's ok.  Good things take time and effort.

UPDATE: Out of town this week on business, so not in front of my build machines.  Plan is to set up a Fedora based build VM and a Fedora based target, compare side-by-side with Omarchy on my Strix Halo box, and identify gaps in the execution.  In the meantime, I've built a ks file to define what I want this to look like.  Any and all feedback welcome to make this a nice project for people other than me.
